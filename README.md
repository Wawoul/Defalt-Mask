# Defalt-Mask
Creating Defalt's mask with LEDs using ESP210 

The purpose of this project was to cosplay the character [Defalt](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/95/4f/17/954f17104d1e1b11a824b0a152b0da4f.jpg) from the game Watch_Dogs for Comic Com. 

Where I desided I would place LEDs in the mask to display different game/anime/emoji patterns.
